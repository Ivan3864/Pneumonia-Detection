    "## Introduction\n",
    "The focus of this project is to develop a deep learning model for the classification of pediatric patients based on chest X-ray images to determine whether they have pneumonia. Pneumonia is a prevalent respiratory infection, particularly affecting children, and early and accurate diagnosis is critical for timely medical intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Problem:**\n",
    "The real-world problem I aim to address is the challenge faced by healthcare professionals in accurately and efficiently diagnosing pneumonia in pediatric patients. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as physical examination and lab tests, can be time-consuming and may not always provide immediate results. In contrast, leveraging deep learning and medical imaging can potentially offer a faster and more reliable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholders:**\n",
    "The primary stakeholders for this project include:\n",
    "1. **Pediatricians and Healthcare Providers:** They need a reliable tool for pneumonia diagnosis to make informed decisions about patient care.\n",
    "2. **Patients and Their Families:** Timely and accurate diagnosis can significantly impact the treatment and recovery of pediatric patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Project Helps:**\n",
    "My project aims to provide a deep learning-based tool that assists healthcare professionals in identifying pneumonia in pediatric patients quickly and accurately. This tool can potentially reduce diagnostic time, minimize the risk of misdiagnosis, and improve overall patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will explore and implement various deep learning techniques for image classification on a dataset of chest X-ray images. I will build, train, and evaluate models to classify these images into two categories: pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I will document my progress and decision-making process, focusing on how my models can be applied to address this real-world medical problem. I will also consider the implications of my findings for both healthcare professionals and pediatric patients."
