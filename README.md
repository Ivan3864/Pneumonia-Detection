# Pneumonia Detection Project
![Alt text](<images/image.jpeg>)
## Overview

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. It involves the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images labeled for the presence of pneumonia.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience

The primary stakeholders for this project are healthcare professionals, radiologists, and medical institutions. The goal is to assist in the early detection of pneumonia through automated analysis of chest X-ray images.

### Dataset Choice

I selected a dataset comprising thousands of chest X-ray images, including both normal and pneumonia-infected cases. The choice of this dataset is crucial for training a reliable model that can be used as a diagnostic support tool.

## Modeling

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture

This model is based on a CNN architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### Data Augmentation

To improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting, I applied various data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width shift, height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip to diversify the training dataset.

## Evaluation

### Model Performance Metrics

I evaluated the model using the following metrics:
- Test Accuracy: 90.38%
- Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
- Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- ROC Curve: Demonstrates the model's discriminative ability with an AUC-ROC of 0.88.

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

- Model 2, with data augmentation, achieved a test accuracy of 90.38%.
- Data augmentation significantly reduced overfitting, enhancing model generalization.
- Visualizations, including loss and accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and sample predictions, provided insights into model performance.

### Recommendations

- Clinical Validation: Collaborate with medical professionals to validate the model's performance on real patient data.
- Ethical Considerations: Ensure data privacy and fairness in model predictions when deploying it in a clinical setting.
- User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the model.
- Regulatory Compliance: Comply with regulatory and legal requirements for clinical deployment.
- Collaboration: Foster collaboration between machine learning experts and medical professionals to align the model with clinical standards.
